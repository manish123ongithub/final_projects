# Project Description
Final projects: car_class_prediction and car_price_prediction. Both projects focus on utilizing machine learning techniques to solve distinct problems related to the automotive industry.

# 1. Car Class Prediction:
The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts the class of a car based on its features. The dataset used for this project contains information about various attributes of cars, such as compactness,circularity,radius ratio and more. By employing machine learning algorithms and techniques, I aim to create a model that can classify cars into their respective classes with high accuracy. This project will involve steps such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

# 2. Car Price Prediction:
The second project focuses on predicting the price of cars using machine learning algorithms. The dataset for this project includes a wide range of attributes, including car specifications,make, model, engine type, fuel efficiency, and other relevant features. The goal is to develop a regression model that can estimate the price of a car based on these attributes. This project will involve preprocessing the data, performing feature selection and engineering, selecting an appropriate regression algorithm, and evaluating the model's performance using relevant metrics such as mean squared error or R-squared.
